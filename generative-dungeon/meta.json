  "description": "Generative Dungeon is a collection of self-contained, complete RPG games stored entirely on the Bitcoin blockchain. No outside server calls. No IPFS network retrievals. No cloud data. All images, sounds, and code are inscribed directly into the ordinal NFTs that make up these dungeons. They will be playable for as long as browsers support Javascript and Bitcoin exists. In other words: a very, very long time.",
