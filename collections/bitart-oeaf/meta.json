    "description": "Of Ebb and Flow is a Comgenerative Art project by BitArt consisting of 310 unique artworks. The code inscribed by the participants in the BitArt Programmable Computer art project was used to generate a unique theme for each artwork in the collection. Of Ebb and Flow uses Bitcoin as a medium to create endless variations on each theme. Every 66 blocks, each artwork transforms into a new painting, only to revert to its original state 6 blocks later. Twice a day, the immutable, fully on-chain artworks change from permanent to transient and back. For any observer, the viewing experience will be entirely different unless initialized at the same block height. Variations on different themes observed at the same block height will be unique as well. Each artwork is cryptographically signed by BitArt.",
