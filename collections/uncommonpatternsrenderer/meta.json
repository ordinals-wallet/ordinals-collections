  "description": "Uncommon Patterns pieces are generated via javascript which appends SVG elements and filters to a blank canvas. Since the outputs are quite heavy and require a desktop computer for rendering, each token was rendered and inscribed as a JPG file with the full forward-backward provenance for the entire collection within its EXIF metadata, inluding the renderer inscription, which is located on its own uncommon sat. This strategy enables holders to be able to dispay their owned pieces on any device and any wallet via JPG format, but also allows them to extract the full piece in SVG format by calling the renderer permanently stored on the Bitcoin blockchain.",
