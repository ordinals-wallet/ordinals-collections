  "description": "Infinites is a unique collection of artworks that were created by the artist FAR between 2018 and 2019. Utilizing artificial intelligence, FAR trained a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on a curated set of paintings from art history, resulting in this series of generated art. This collection bears resemblance to the base images used in the generative art collections Infinites AI and IRL, which were originally minted by FAR on the Ethereum blockchain in 2021. As of now, these selected artworks from the Infinites collection are fully on-chain on the Bitcoin blockchain.",
