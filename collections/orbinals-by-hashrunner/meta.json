  "description": "ORBinals is the genesis project of hashrunner and is a series of 16 (+ a 1/1) animated and dynamic ASCII orb artworks. ORBinals also evolve over time, with the year difference from 2023 altering the entropy and resulting in a different color/pattern/thickness combinations, creating artwork that leans into and changes with the Bitcoin timechain itself. \n\nEach piece in the series apart from the 1/1 is generated using its inscription hash as a source of entropy. The 1/1 was generated using the Bitcoin genesis block hash and unlike the others, will look exactly like this, forever.\n\nArtist:\nhashrunner is multi-disciplinary builder based in Madrid, working on the intersection of design, engineering, product and protocol. Over the last year, projects like Loot, Art Blocks and Terraforms have captivated him to explore composable on-chain NFTs, as well as long-from generative art and runtime art more deeply. A few unfinished, Ethereum-based artistic projects, and one ordinals rabbit hole later, his genesis collection ORBinals was born on the Bitcoin timechain.",
