  "description": "This is a low time preference Bitcoin-only project! We focus on uniqueness and high quality inscriptions. Series 1 is timepieces - antique pocket watches, cyberpunk clocks, and other timepieces imagined from times past, present and future to represent Bitcoin as the heartbeat of humanity. Some unique things about this series: - All 21 items were inscribed in a single block on Jan 30 (PST) - Artwork was inspired by @dergigi 's Bitcoin is Time. - Inscriptions are very low, consecutive from 356-377 - These inscriptions are anchored with a genesis inscription (#356) containing a PGP key. - 1/3 of supply will be air dropped on Twitter, NOSTR, and Discord.",
