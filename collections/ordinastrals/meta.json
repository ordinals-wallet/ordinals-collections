  "description": "Ordinastrals is a collection of 69 portraits for connoisseurs - All inscribed exclusively on special satoshis - This collection is about Astral Projections exploring the Ordinals. Astral Projections assume the existence of an Astral body, through which consciousness can function separately from the physical body and travel throughout the Astral Plane. These portraits are like us, Ordinals explorers, adventurers going on a journey, looking for the special grail, making frens, making new connections, discovering special sats, learning about the history of some satoshis, and scarcity of some sats, finding the perfect portraits for one's PFP, travelling and exploring new meta realms, always learning and having fun. That is what matters. That is what is important, and that is what will last forever. Each portrait is inspired by our thirst for quest of unlimited possibilities. These feelings and memories will last forever, like these inscriptions on BTC the best museum that ever existed. We are part of history...",
