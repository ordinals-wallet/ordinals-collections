  "description": "Sat Black is a groundbreaking digital verifiable collectible. It includes a unique pen and ink illustration referencing the first physical verifiable collectible, the Penny Black stamp, released in 1840 and considered a collectibles cultural icon. The Penny Black was the first adhesive postage stamp used in a public postal system. Each individual stamp featured 2 letters identifying its location on the printing plate. The Sat Black uses ordinal theory to inscribe a verifiable credential onto a specific satoshi with a variety of metadata, including a digital signature proving authenticity. This digital collectible uses decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials to create new opportunities for true utility with ordinals. Art by Harold Richter.",
