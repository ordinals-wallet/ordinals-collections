  "description": "KekleBerry is a fun collection of 111 original egg characters immutably inscribed on individual satoshis on the Bitcoin blockchain. Our breakfast menu offers a selection of 80's retro-styled artworks infused with various web 3.0 moods. They embody several significant elements of our collective crypto culture, such as GM culture, gaming culture (KEK = LOL iykyk), our love for the best breakfast dish on the menu (cackleberry is an American slang for eggs), crypto slangs, and memes. The project team is a seasoned group of crypto artists with many innovative and successful collaborations and personal projects on various blockchains. Join our Discord and follow us on Twitter! It's time to have a Kekly-good time!",
