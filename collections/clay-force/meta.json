  "description": "This community-curated collection features seven unique characters, each handcrafted from clay and originally from a different blockchain. After falling through a burn portal, these characters found themselves stripped of their identities and trapped in unwanted alien bodies. Now, 153 of these characters have emerged on satoshis, leaving their holders on a quest to unlock their true human forms. The collection was self-minted and registered under the 200k inscription mark by the artist and founder, Brrrbon.",
