  "description": "\"Gleam\" is a project dedicated to collectors and supporters of the artist's first generative project, \"Rays\".At the core of this artwork is an exploration of the essence of photography – the manipulation of light to create an image. Instead of capturing a static moment in time, the artist takes us on a journey through a constantly shifting landscape of colors and shapes. This creates an immersive and hypnotic experience for the viewer.\"Gleam\" further experiments with blending lights and colors to create intriguing structures inspired by natural phenomena. Through a chaotic and fluid movement, new realities emerge, with distorted colors and wavy shapes blending and mixing to create an intricate play of lights. The animation is in constant, infinite motion.Technical specs:- infinite long-form generative animation- resolution agnostic- HTML, VanillaJS, WebGL (no external libraries)- 6.7 kB- 100% on-chain- 3 features/traits: Palette, Lights, Individual",
