{"name":"Ordinastrals","slug":"Ordinastrals","supply":"69","description":"Ordinastrals is a collection of 69 portraits for connoisseurs - All portraits are inscribed on special sats (uncommon, palindrome, pizza, ...) - This collection is about Astral Projections coming to Ordinals. Astral Projections assume the existence of a subtle body, aka Astral Body or Body of Light, through which consciousness can function separately from the physical body and travel throughout the Astral Plane. The idea of Astral Projection is ancient and occurs in multiple cultures. It is associated with dreams and forms of meditation. Perceptions can be similar to those induced by hallucinogenic means.","twitter_link":"https://twitter.com/SasugaRackham","discord_link":"","website_link":"","inscription_icon":"89cd6c14c4cf0f19d160ba5341afbe6138299268297955e09642d116689b640ai0"}
