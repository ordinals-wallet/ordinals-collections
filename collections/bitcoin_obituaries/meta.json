  "description": "How many times has Bitcoin died, to date? 473 times, yet it has managed to survive and thrive in spite of the constant negative news. This generative art collection explores the concept of Bitcoin obituaries through the lens of code. The particles are set in motion using Lissajous curves, giving them a motion similar to writing. As soon as a particle fades, another one emerges to life, symbolizing the resilience of the Bitcoin blockchain. Particle data like colors or gradients are set by Bitcoin obituary data contained inside the code.Created with Vanilla JS The code contains all 473 bitcoin obituaries, data acquired from https://99bitcoins.com/bitcoin-obituaries/ One random obituary is pulled from the code and used to generate the image.",
