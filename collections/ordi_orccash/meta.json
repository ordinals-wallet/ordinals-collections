ORC-CASH protocol allows valid Mint inscriptions to be traded as the tokens themselves, just like cash bills with a serial number. All Mint inscriptions included in this collection will always be valid in the ORC-CASH Indexers until they are sent to a Burn Wallet address which will take them out of circulation.",
