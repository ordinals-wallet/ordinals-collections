  "description": "Endangered Ordinals is a series of verifiable collectibles featuring hand illustrated depictions of endangered animals. The Holocene mass extinction is happening all around us and it is under our stewardship that the earth loses 150-200 plant and animal species a day. With this series we hope to bring attention to the crisis of rapidly declining global biodiversity. By connecting art and conservation, we aim to spark a deeper understanding and appreciation for the irreplaceable natural treasures we stand to lose. Ordinals Reserve will donate 5.1% of the sale of each Endangered Ordinal to the WWF.",
