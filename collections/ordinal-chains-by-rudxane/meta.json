  "description": "Ordinal Chains is among the first gen art projects using Ordinals on the Bitcoin blockchain. The project is based on a single file that uses the convention on ordinals.com to fetch the genesis transaction id from the inscription and use that as the seed to create a deterministic output from random values.\n\nArtist:\nrudxane is a visual artist from Amsterdam, working on computer art since the 90s. He is exploring the interplay of artist/machine through the generative medium by introducing human characteristics in a generative system. His latest work ‘Hypnagogic‘ was exhibited by Verse in London (December 2022) and minted as a digital collection on Ethereum.",
