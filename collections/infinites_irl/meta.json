  "description": "Infinites Real Life (IRL) is a set of 993 unique FAR artworks originally minted on Ethereum in 2021, now fully on-chain on Bitcoin. Like Infinites AI, each IRL is created through two generative processes: A StyleGAN trained on the Great Masters' works, and an on-chain process that enhances selected outputs. An additional on-chain generative process was used to generate the final artwork, contributing more depth. Custom software, written in three.js, uses Ethereum data at minting for stylistic gestures. IRLs are designed for exhibition display. Storing IRL in Bitcoin demonstrated the potential of Ordinals, preserving each artwork's empowering recursive inscriptions.",
