  "description": "This is my world, the world of the aliens who live on the stars surrounding the planet Saneyaman, where \"Saneyama World\" is located! They all look different, like different things, and have different names, but it is precisely because they are different that they all get along. Let's all get our own unique aliens and become friends with them!",
